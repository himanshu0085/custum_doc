## 2️⃣ Use Cases & How It Works

### A) GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

**Integrated automation service within GitHub repositories**

**Use Cases**
- Automatic builds on push / pull requests  
- Unit and integration testing  
- Deployment pipelines (Dev / UAT / Production)  
- Security scanning and quality checks  

**Benefits**
- Reduced manual errors  
- Standardized releases  
- Automated rollback and alerts  

---

### B) GitHub Copilot (AI Coding Assistant)

**AI-powered assistant supporting the entire development lifecycle**

**Use Cases**
- Code autocomplete and function generation  
- Code explanation in plain English  
- Unit test generation  
- Code review assistance  
- AI-based pull request drafting  

**Example Prompt**
> Generate CRUD endpoints for Product API
